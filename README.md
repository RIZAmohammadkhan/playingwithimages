## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate how to manipulate the color of images using PyTorch. By rearranging the tensors representing the color channels in an image, you can create various artistic effects, color transformations, and more. This project serves as a playground for exploring the creative possibilities of image manipulation in the PyTorch framework.
